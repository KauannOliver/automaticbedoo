## Publication boundaries

- Operational sources remained read-only; only isolated copies were prepared.
- No corporate service, real-record import, live notification or production database was invoked.
- No deployment command, deploy workflow or new hosting integration is part of this update. Included Vercel configurations disable Git-driven deployments.
- New source imports exclude local environments, databases, generated outputs and operational documents.
- Existing Git history is preserved. Historical public names or assets may remain in old commits; current snapshots use neutral public presentation.
